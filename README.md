# Yactatt — Yet Another CTA Transit Tracker

The main goal is to eventually drive an LED matrix and prettily display exactly
how late I'll be to literally everything in Chicago all the goddamned time.
And I'll want to see whether buses and trains will actually show up or just vaporize
into thin air—that is, I'd like to see a visual distinction between scheduled buses
and physically present ones.

This is a fun project made out of a mixture of love and spite plus a desire to do
something fun with Nerves and Raspberry Pi, but this simple library is enough just
to show bus times and locations, along with some other information like whether
it's delayed.

Be kind to your drivers and conductors.
They do not get paid enough to deal with everything they do.
